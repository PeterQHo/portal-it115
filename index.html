       <p>Hello, my name is Peter Ho, I am currently working toward a certificate to gain experience with working in application development at year up where they are helping to close the opportunity divide. I have graduated from Central Washington Unversity with a bachelor of science degree in business administration with a concentration in marketing I have worked in retail and wanted to create a path for me to get into the tech industry. My experiences have gave me the  ability to adapt to fast-paced environments and to communicate better with others.</p>
       
       <p>  My goal is to gain the technical ability to create a path for me to get a job in the tech industry. I hope to be able to gain the skill to transition into game development. I invite everyone to connect with me on LinkedIn if they are interested in learning more about myself or my experiences. I am a huge gamer I love most game and have been enjoying them since I was younger and have had made many friends for playing games. I have been interested in gaming since I was a kid and wanted to pursue a career towards it.</p>

       <p>Accomplishment that I am proud of is getting my bachelor degree. As I felt like that the hard work that I did was worth it. I became proud of and had something to show it.</p>
